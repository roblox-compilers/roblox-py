Python, Lunar, C, C++ Compiler for Roblox.

Python 3.13 (dev), C (all versions), C++ (all versions), Lunar -> Lua(u)

> C/C++ is still in progress.

> Lunar is a language based on MoonScript made for Roblox, at the moment they are identical.

> Python is fully implemented, all code should work because it supports the dev build of Python 3.13.
